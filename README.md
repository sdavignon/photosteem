# PhotoSteem

A photo social sharing network built on top of Steem Blockchain

The motivation for this project was at the same time a need to explore more about blockchain development, but also, being myself a  photographer on a hobby level,  the frustration of using services like instagram where every photo is a square image and there’s not really a focus on the photography community; besides of course that on Steem you can actually make money from your work and built yourself around a new and exciting marketplace.

This project would be a lot more painful if it wasn’t for the excellent already build tools that have supported me building this platform:

[steem-js](https://github.com/steemit/steem-js)
[steemconnect](https://github.com/adcpm/steemconnect)
